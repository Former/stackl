BUGS

Exit fails after return from main

TODO

include files from proper directories

library code included by default (e.g. syscal and halt)

Return from main calls exit() not HALT_OP
Rudimentary scheduler
Fork loads at different addr

command line args to main

assignment to charp vars
    array cell address
address-of operator

short circuit of && and ||
proper implementation of structs

full semantic checks
make opcodes an enum?

-help for stackl and stacklc

WORKS

allow global decls include consts
validate that a Function Call is a function
syscalls for print, scan, exit, exec
address of in params
string_lit as function arg
-ast command line argument to stacklc
charp vars as arrays
include files
assign cptr to string_lit
can declare char * vars and char[] 
can access individual chars in a char array
pointer arithmetic
character literals
expressions
Unary minus
++ -- <op>=
Test of all operators
if statements (including else)
while statements
for loops
rudimentary function calls
return statements
function return values
functions in expressions
function parameters
strings literals
prints

    int
    char *       isPointer
    char []      isArray
    string_lit   isAbsolute

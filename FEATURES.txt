TODO

Clean up test suite
    Get rid of useless tests
    Comment block indicating purpose of test
    Mimimise assumptions
        Assume previous tests pass, but not later ones

Include files for "regular" C code to mimic stackl C code.

optimizations:
   ptr[0] -> *ptr

full semantic checks
   matching function params
   only one function body
casting an int into a char

command line args to main

WORKS

BUGS

TODO

JUMPs and RETURNs need to be relative?
OR: GetMem/SetMem relative to base reg

Include files for "regular" C code to mimic stackl C code.

command line args to main

assignment to charp vars
    array cell address
address-of operator

short circuit of && and ||
proper implementation of structs

full semantic checks
make opcodes an enum?

-help for stackl and stacklc

WORKS

Have I/O happen in separate thread so that a GET does not block all threads.
Rudimentary scheduler
include files from proper directories
Fork loads at different addr
Return from main calls exit() not HALT_OP
library code is included by default (e.g. syscal and halt)
allow global decls include consts
validate that a Function Call is a function
syscalls for print, scan, exit, exec
address of in params
string_lit as function arg
-ast command line argument to stacklc
charp vars as arrays
include files
assign cptr to string_lit
can declare char * vars and char[] 
can access individual chars in a char array
pointer arithmetic
character literals
expressions
Unary minus
++ -- <op>=
Test of all operators
if statements (including else)
while statements
for loops
rudimentary function calls
return statements
function return values
functions in expressions
function parameters
strings literals
prints

type taxonomy
    int
    char *       isPointer
    char []      isArray
    string_lit   isAbsolute

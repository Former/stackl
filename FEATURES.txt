TODO

seems to be a problem in string.h and system.h are included in some orders

command line args

assignment to charp vars
    array cell address
address-of operator

short circuit of && and ||
full semantic checks
make opcodes an enum?
proper command line argument processing for stackl
remove the requirement for /*END*/

WORKS

syscalls for print, scan, exit, exec
address of in params
string_lit as function arg
-ast command line argument to stacklc
gets getl geti
charp vars as arrays
include files
assign cptr to string_lit
can declare char * vars and char[] 
can access individual chars in a char array
pointer arithmetic
character literals
print statements
expressions
Unary minus
++ -- <op>=
Test of all operators
if statements (including else)
while statements
for loops
rudimentary function calls
return statements
function return values
functions in expressions
function parameters
strings literals
prints

type taxonomy
    int
    char *       isPointer
    char []      isArray
    string_lit   isAbsolute

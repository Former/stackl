doubly defined functions from separate compilation units
Doubly defined global vars from separate compilation units:

Make a proper pre-processor

function return types
    validate the type of thing in return statement
    Don't force return 0 at end of functions

Implement machine check interrupt vector. User mode machine checks trap, OS mode machine checks halt.

figure out gcc generating dependencies

const optimizations

static vars at global and local level

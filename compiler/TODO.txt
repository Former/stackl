Couldn't open <io.h   Need to fix error message.

Fix the broken tests
figure out gcc generating dependencies

const optimizations
multi-D arrays
   mBaseType for multi-D arrays is not correct
   mBaseType for cArrayRef[3][2] on second index

redo test suite

Add semantic checks

cSymbol has Decl
    types: cTypeDecl
    func:  cFuncDecl
        return type
    var:   cVarDecl
        base type

cExpr
    GetType
        Binary: result type
        Int:    sym("int")->GetDecl
        Var:    mType->GetDecl

expr should include assign as operators
    Test assign operator expr in other expr

throw semantic_error on ',' in expr list

allow structs separate from typedef?

static vars at global and local level

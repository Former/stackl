Bugs:

loader can't handle "\nthis is a test\n" (or probably any other string with two control codes)

Todo:

in compiler, -boot means "don't include startup.h"

Allow local variables in TRAP handler

Implement TRAP handler in machine mem

Implement priv instructions:
   ena/dis interrupts
   get/set processor state
   INP instruction
Implement Process Control Block in Machine mem
update exe format
Implement load in machine: requires disk I/O
Implement fork() exec() in machine
Implement sched in machine

Done:
Change syscalls to use I/O architecture and run in Machine
Implement Interrupt mechanism
Implement priv instructions:
   RTI
Implement Timer interrupt

Design I/O architecture
   IOBlock: instr, addr, status
       instr: INS, INC, INL
       addr: abs Memory[] addr of buffer
       status: queued, pending, done

Input syscall does IO instr and polls for completion.

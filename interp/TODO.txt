HALT:
    user mode: trap handler? or Machine Check ISR?
    >> it now machine checks to vector zero

Complete tests of gen_io device
Test of INP EXEC: same program, but checks for user mode vs. sys mode
    set BP, LP after INP instruction, before wait loop to make sure INP 
    instruction saves them

Implement virtual memory
    Use bit in FLAG reg
    Need Page Table register
    Need Page Fault interrupt
Machine Check handler
    >> user mode: trap
    >> system mode: halt

Better documentation of INP instruction including error codes

Bugs:

loader can't handle "\nthis is a test\n" (or probably any other string with two control codes)

Todo:

Implement Process Control Block in Machine mem
Implement load in machine: requires disk I/O
Implement fork() in machine
Implement sched in machine

Done:
exec() works in machine
   Using C Load()
update exe format
Move INP into TRAP handler
Allow local variables in TRAP handler
   can call function with locals
Fix loader for better memory layout and file format
Implement TRAP handler in machine mem
in compiler, -boot means "don't include startup.h"
Change syscalls to use I/O architecture and run in Machine
Implement Interrupt mechanism
Implement priv instructions:
   RTI
   get/set processor state
   INP instruction
   ena/dis interrupts
Implement Timer interrupt

Design I/O architecture
   IOBlock: instr, addr, status
       instr: INS, INC, INL
       addr: abs Memory[] addr of buffer
       status: queued, pending, done

Input syscall does IO instr and polls for completion.

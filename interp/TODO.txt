HALT:
    user mode: trap handler? or Machine Check ISR?
INP instruction: ISR on completion option
OUTS instruction: ISR on completion option: async

Machine Checks
    call dbg function to inform debugger that it happened
Implement virtual memory
    Use bit in FLAG reg
    Need Page Table register
    Need Page Fault interrupt
Machine Check handler
    user mode: trap
    system mode: halt

Better documentation of INP instruction including error codes
